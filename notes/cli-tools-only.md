# CLI Tools Only

From personal experiences, because `nix` and `home-manager` is used in a
non-NixOS distro, the full declarative power is not unleashed. For example,
`alacritty` and `kitty` can be installed and appears within the `$PATH`, but
errors occur on trying to open them. Same goes for declarative Firefox: it
runs as expected, but custom IBus does not.

A more "hardcore" person may goes the "full NixOS" path, but `nix` and
`home-manager` is working well enough for me.
